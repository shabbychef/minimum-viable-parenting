Summary: some brief advice on fatherhood, as if you asked.
Author: Steven

When our first child was born, I received some excellent tactical advice in the hospital,
 _viz_:

1. Sleep when they sleep.
2. Never walk empty handed from one room to another.
3. Something else, which I have forgotten.

In addition to these gems, I feel I can offer some more strategic advice. This is an 
incomplete list of what I wasn't expecting when we were expecting:

1. **You're not gonna remember this.**
2. **Kill your identity.** [Paul Graham argues](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html "identity")
